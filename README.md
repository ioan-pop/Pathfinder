Visual pathfinding algorithm. Made with React (and love).  
[Check it out!](https://ioan-pop.github.io/Pathfinder/)  

## How to use

First click will create a start square (red)  
Second click will create an end square (blue)  
Additional clicks (or click and drag) will create wall squares (dark blue)  

## Algorithms

Breadth first  
Depth first  
Best first (or Informed) (To be implemented)
A* (To be implemented)

## TODOs

Implement info modal on launch  
Reset algorithm  
Add multiple destinations  
User editable number of squares  
User editable speed of search
